            <h4>Pizza is a savory dish made with a wheat flour dough base topped with tomato 
                sauce, cheese, and various toppings, and baked in an oven until the crust is 
                crispy.</h4>

                <p>
                    To make pizza at home, you will need to start by preheating your oven to 
                    425 degrees Fahrenheit. Next, you will need to prepare your dough by 
                    mixing together flour, water, yeast, and salt until a smooth dough forms. 
                    Allow the dough to rise for about an hour, or until it has doubled in size. 
                    Once the dough is ready, roll it out into a large circle and place it on a 
                    baking sheet or pizza pan. Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, 
                    leaving a small border around the edge. Sprinkle cheese over the sauce, and 
                    then add any desired toppings, such as vegetables, meats, or herbs. Finally, 
                    bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the 
                    crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Allow the pizza to 
                    cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
